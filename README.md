##Data below
If you want to know where these imaginary numbers are used in real 
world then here are few examples, in mathematics I’m sure everyone 
is aware of quadratic equations and 
certainly in schooling days we have 
come across using complex numbers 
there. And we also use it in 
electricity, especially in alternating 
current (AC). Where? How? Why? If 
these are questions in your mind 
then you can personally read about it.


n set we cannot access single elements because internally set does 
not store the data in the order we provide it. That is the reason it 
is called unordered collection of data. And as it is unordered data, 
certainly it doesn’t have indices.
